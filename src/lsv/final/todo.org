#+TYP_TODO: Flotisable Shawpee NotAssigned | DONE
* Interface
** NotAssigned write the help desription of the command
** DONE read circuit
** DONE transtorm circuit to BDD
** Shawpee dump BDD
** Shawpee test
* Core
** Shawpee find the best BDD variable order to make the decomposition more disjoint
** DONE check there are only two functions of y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4
** Flotisable build the function of select input of MUX by the truth table of y's
** Flotisable split the BDD into three sub circuit
